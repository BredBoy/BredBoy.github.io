                <h2>War of the Third Coalition</h2>
                <p>The War of the Third Coalition was a European conflict from 1805 to 1806. It involved France and its client states led by Napoleon I, who opposed an alliance known as the Third Coalition. The Third Coalition consisted of the United Kingdom, the Austrian Empire, the Russian Empire, Naples, Sicily, and Sweden. Prussia remained neutral during the war. Major land operations led to a swift French victory, including the Ulm Campaign and the Battle of Austerlitz.</p>

                <h2>War of the Fourth Coalition</h2>
                <p>The War of the Fourth Coalition was a major conflict during the Napoleonic Wars that took place from October 1806 to June 1807. The coalition consisted of Russia, Prussia, Saxony, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, while the French Empire, the Confederation of the Rhine, Polish rebels, and Spain fought against them. Napoleon achieved significant victories against Prussia at Jena and Auerstädt in 1806 and against Russia at Friedland in 1807. The resulting Peace of Tilsit marked a high point in Napoleon’s power.</p>

            <div class="wars" id="thirdWar">
                <h2>War of the Fifth Coalition</h2>
                <p>The War of the Fifth Coalition was a major conflict during the Napoleonic Wars that took place from April to July 1809. The coalition consisted of Austria, the United Kingdom, Portugal, and several German states, while France and its allies fought against them. The war saw several battles, including the Battle of Aspern-Essling and the Battle of Wagram, which were both fought in Austria. The Treaty of Schönbrunn signed on October 14, 1809, marked the end of the war and resulted in significant territorial losses for Austria.</p>

            <div class="wars" id="fourthWar">
                <h2>War of the Sixth Coalition</h2>
                <p>The War of the Sixth Coalition was a coalition of Austria, Prussia, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Sweden, Sardinia, and a number of German States that defeated France and drove Napoleon into exile on Elba. The war saw major battles at Lützen, Bautzen, and Dresden. The even larger Battle of Leipzig (also known as the Battle of Nations) was the largest battle in European history before World War I. Ultimately, Napoleon’s earlier setbacks in Spain, Portugal and Russia proved to be the seeds of his undoing.</p>

            <div class="wars" id="fifthWar">
                <h2>War of the Seventh Coalition</h2>
                <p>The War of the Seventh Coalition, also known as the Hundred Days War, spanned from March 20 to July 8, 1815. It marked the period between Napoleon’s return from exile on the island of Elba to Paris and the second restoration of King Louis XVIII. The coalition consisted of Austria, Prussia, Russia, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Sweden, Spain, and a number of other countries. The war culminated in the Battle of Waterloo and ended with Napoleon’s defeat and exile to Saint Helena.</p>

                <h2>Peninsular War</h2>
                <p>The Peninsular War (1807–1814) was a military conflict fought in the Iberian Peninsula by Spain, Portugal, and the United Kingdom against the invading and occupying forces of the First French Empire during the Napoleonic Wars. It is considered to overlap with the Spanish War of Independence. The war started when the French and Spanish armies invaded and occupied Portugal in 1807 by transiting through Spain. The war on the peninsula lasted until the Sixth Coalition defeated Napoleon in 1814. It is regarded as one of the first wars of national liberation.</p>

            <div class="wars" id="seventWar">
                <h2>French invasion of Russia</h2>
                <p>The French invasion of Russia took place in 1812 during the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon’s army marched into Moscow but was forced into retreat after the Russian army refused to engage in battle. The invasion resulted in the deaths of more than 400,000 French soldiers, mostly due to cold and starvation.</p>
